          <b>Food Waste</b>

          <p>⅓ of all food is wasted/thrown out/goes in the bin</p><br>
          <p>Food production is responsible for about 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions</p><br>
          <p>Of the global freshwater usage, 70 percent is used for agriculture</p><br>

            <p>Lack of knowledge about nutrition and a healthy lifestyle affects public health greatly</p><br>
            <p>Education levels impact knowledge of nutrition and a healthy lifestyle and therefore educational
              programs from an early age are necessary to combat social inequalities</p><br>

        <p>We aim to solve the issue of food waste and ensuring a more sustainable future for the younger
          generations by putting the idea of “from farm to table” into practice. We get the “ugly” produce
          directly from farmers and pack it together with relevant recipes and information of where it came from.
          These boxes are sent to schools that have partnered with us and then used in their food and health teaching.
          This way students learn not only that vegetables come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, but they also
          get to enjoy food from local farms and see in practice what a sustainable future looks like.
